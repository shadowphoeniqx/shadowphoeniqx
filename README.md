👨🏽‍💻 Lukman A. Allison –  Cybersecurity Analyst 

Hey there 👋🏽 — Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Lukman A. Allison, a  Cybersecurity Analyst with strong hands-on, real-world cybersecurity skills.
I specialize in threat detection, log analysis, vulnerability management, and network security engineering — turning theory into practice every single day.

Through dedicated labs, cloud projects, and real-world simulations, I've built a solid intermediate-level cybersecurity skillset — and I’m always expanding it to stay ahead of evolving threats.

🛡️ What I Focus On

🔹 SIEM & Threat Monitoring – Deploying and tuning Wazuh, Elastic Stack, and Suricata IDS.
🔹 Incident Detection & Log Analysis – Investigating Sysmon logs, threat hunting with Kibana.
🔹 Vulnerability Assessment – Scanning with OpenVAS, Nessus, and active network mapping with Nmap.
🔹 Cloud Security Labs – Building AWS cloud labs, securing infrastructure, practicing offensive techniques safely.
🔹 Phishing and Malware Analysis – Analyzing phishing emails, PDFs, and malware samples with Ghidra and sandboxes.
🔹 Network Security Engineering – Deploying personal VPNs, analyzing traffic with Wireshark.
